  <section id="about">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi, I’m Erick — a first-class honors graduate in Aeronautical Engineering with a passion for tech, innovation, and problem-solving. My background combines solid engineering principles with hands-on experience from internships, leadership roles, and collaborative projects.</p>
    <p>I’m especially interested in the intersection between engineering and emerging technologies. My final year project focused on using YOLO computer vision models and Arduino microcontrollers to address Foreign Object Debris (FOD) detection challenges in aviation—a reflection of my drive to create real-world, impactful solutions.</p>
    <p>Currently, I’m deepening my skills in software development through the Power Learn Project Africa scholarship, as I explore how technology can reshape industries like transport, energy, and aviation.</p>
